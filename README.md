# Advanced ruby building blocks

This project features the solutions to the advanced ruby problems in the odin-project [the odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/advanced-building-blocks) ruby course.

The goal was a) to write a bubble sort method and using yield, and also to write your own Enumerable functions like #each, #each_with_index, #all?, #any?, #none?, #count, #map, and #inject. 

This project helps to understand the "yield" statement and procs.
